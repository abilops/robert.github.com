<h1>About me</h1>

<p>
  I work on security <a href="/2014/03/07/lessons-from-a-silicon-valley-job-search/">at Stripe</a>. I'm interested in

  and <a href="/2016/04/09/in-context/">writing stories</a>. I also like chess, but I haven't written any blog posts about that. I used to <a href="/2014/10/25/tales-from-a-san-francisco-housing-search/">live in San Francisco</a>. Now I live in London.

<p>
I do <a href="/2018/07/17/office-hours">weekly office hours</a> where I talk about programming with anyone who signs up. I think they are most useful for "<a href="/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/">Advanced Beginners</a>" who are working towards getting their first job as a programmer. But regardless of who you are, if this sounds interesting and useful then <a href="/2018/07/17/office-hours">I'd love to hear from you</a>.
