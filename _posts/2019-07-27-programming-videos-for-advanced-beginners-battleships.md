I've published [my first video series: Programming Videos for Advanced Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTr5OF9MRCg&list=PLw22WCqAVCN6EXylkzhtMwvgcLq4TrcQX). In it we build a terminal version of the popular board game, Battleships.

In 3 action-packed hours you'll learn:

* How to weigh up different design choices and think about the tradeoffs between them
* How and why to split up code so that each piece is responsible for exactly 1 thing
* When and how to use classes
* And so much more

We don't use any esoteric libraries, and instead focus on transferrable programming fundamentals that apply in any language and to any project. The project is written in Python, but we don't use any Python-specific syntax, and it should be entirely understandable to anyone with experience in Javascript, Ruby, PHP, or any other language.

The response to my [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners](/ppab) blog post series has been fantastic, and I made this video series to bring its same, detail-oriented approach to the big screen. I hope you enjoy it and I'd love to [hear any and all feedback](/about).
