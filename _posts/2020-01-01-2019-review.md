Thank you to everyone who has read or supported my blog over the past year, I really appreciate it. To coin a new yearly habit:

## 2019 review

I had a baby. For more details, start at the post "[Childbirth: a father's eye view][p1]" and work forwards.

I started writing a book called "[Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners][ppab]", based on my blog post series of the same name. I also started a [new mailing list][pfab] of weekly tips for Advanced Beginners. I held 20 [office hours][office-hours] sessions, and published my [first video series about programming][video]. I don't think the videos were particularly good, but I'm excited about the book. I published [38 blog posts][archive]. My favorites were:

* [Making peace with Simpson's Paradox][simpsons]
* [I was 7 words away from being spear-phished][phish]
* [Peeking through stock option exercise windows][stock]

I took a 3 month sabbatical from work to intern at a charity called [GiveWell][givewell]. Then I went back to work and joined a new team, where we hunt for malicious actors inside our networks.

I got to [silver rank in Rocket League][rocket-league].

## 2020 plans

* Finish and publish "[Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners][ppab]" book
* Take 4 months of parental leave
* Publish to my new [Advanced Beginners mailing list][pfab] once a week for the entire year
* Publish 25 normal blog posts
* More [office hours][office-hours] (no targets)
* Release 5 track synthwave EP

See you this time next year.
