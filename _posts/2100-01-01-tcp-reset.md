# What is the point of this post?
Show you how to do TCP reset
Teach you the details of TCP reset
Teach you the basics of TCP reset

History of TCP reset and mitigations

What should the title convey?
This actually shows you how to do one
Contains details
Contains beginners guide

Could do the TCP guide first
I'm a little loathe to do a full TCP guide at this point
Could just make a little tool to analyze TCP conversations
Not aiming to fully understand everything - just clearly describe the simple cases

Analyzing real TCP conversations
Explain the basics of TCP but don't go into window sizes or other fancy things
Don't say "this assumes knowledge of". Just say "this won't tell you about the fancy bits"

Understanding TCP by analyzing real connections

tcp-conversational - a tool to help you understand the TCP protocol by analyzing real connections

The goal of this post is to help you fully understand the central ideas of TCP
This means sequence numbers, acks, and flags
We won't talk about window sizes or edge cases
We'll just fully understand how TCP creates a realiable stream of data over an unreliable network
Also how TCP relates to IP etc

We'll do this using tcp-conversational, a simple tool
It's like Wireshark and tcpdump, but with most of the details removed and formatted so as to make understanding the conversation easier



# OSI model
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3439#section-3
The separation is not complete, which makes thinking about it a bit harder but makes the product better
Reasonable to start by assuming that the layers are perfect abstractions

Each layer is built on top of the layer before it
Presents a new layer to those that come after it so that (in theory) these layers don't have to worry about the ones before

Maybe this should be a post of its own?

The Great Firewall is the name given to a collection of systems and techniques used by the Chinese government to censor the internet inside China. The government is believed to monitor the Chinese internet. It does this at the *gateway routers* at the edge of the country's network. These are the routers where traffic leaves China and heads out onto the rest of the internet. It also has numerous wiretaps throughout the Chinese national network.

The first layer of the firewall uses *IP blocking* and *DNS pollution* to prevent users from even making contact with forbidden servers. In IP blocking, the government maintains a hardcoded list of forbidden IP addresses and prevents users from talking to those IP addresses. In DNS pollution, the government interferes with the process by which computers translate URLs (like `robertheaton.com`, which the internet backbone does not understand) into IP addresses (like `104.18.32.191`).

Both of these techniques rely on the government being able to analyze a user's intended connection before it has even begun and to make a rapid decision whether to allow or block it. However, the government may also wish to perform analysis that is either slower, or that allows a connection to begin and monitors the data being exchanged before deciding to shut off the connection halfway through. Neither IP blocking nor DNS pollution are suitable for killing such connections. If a connection has already been opened then the client must have already resolved their target domain into an IP address, and so do not need to make any more DNS requests. DNS pollution is therefore unsuitable. And it is infeasible for dynamic updates to the IP blocklist to be pushed out fast enough to block a connection that is already in progress. Even if these techniques did work, they might be considered too heavy-handed, even for the Chinese government. They are only suitable for completely blocking access to entire websites for the entire country. The Great Firewall is known for its over-zealousness, and completely blocking to an entire website on the basis of a misinterpreted keyword could be unnecessarily disruptive.

The government therefore needs a more surgical tool, one that is capable of killing already-made connections without causing disruption to other Chinese internet users. The tool that they use is the *TCP reset attack*.

## How does a TCP reset attack work?

In a TCP reset attack, an attacker kills a connection between two victims by sending one or both victims them fake packets of data saying that the other party has terminated the connection. If the fake packets are crafted correctly, the recipient will accept them and close the connection for real, preventing further information from being exchanged between the victims. The victims can create a new TCP connection to attempt to resume their communications, but the attacker may be able to reset that connection as well.

The TCP reset attack is an ideal censorship tool for the Chinese government. If the GFW sees no reason to prevent a connection from being initialized, but later decides that it wants to kill it, it can do so using a TCP reset attack.

### Is a TCP reset attack difficult to execute?

A TCP reset attack is conceptually simple, but in practice challenging to pull off. In order to see why it is so hard, we'll need to understand how the TCP protocol works. We'll study it in much more detail in part 3.

A TCP *stream* is a stream of data, in the form that the sender sent it. If I send you the HTML for this website over a TCP stream, your computer's TCP stack will output that HTML in the exact form that I sent it. However, the HTML is not sent over the internet in this perfect, consistent form. Instead, it is broken up into many small chunks (known as *TCP segments*), which are sent separately over the internet and reconstituted into a contiguous piece of data by your TCP stack.

This task is made much harder by the fact that the internet is not reliable. TCP segments may get lost, arrive out of order, be sent twice, get corrupted, or have any number of other mishaps befall them. The job of the TCP protocol is to provide reliable communication over an unreliable network.

Reliable communication is achieved by each side of a TCP connection keeping in close contact and telling each other what data they have received. If one party hasn't received a segment that the other party has sent, the sender will resend it.

Segments are tracked using *sequence numbers*. Every segment has a sequence number, assigned to it by the machine sending it. The first segment sent by a machine is assigned a random *initial sequence number*. Every subsequent segment's sequence number is equal to the sequence number of the previous segment, plus the number of bytes of data in the previous segment. The receiving machine uses these sequence numbers to reconstruct the segments into their original order, and to detect if it is missing any segments.

When a machine receives a TCP segment, it tells the sender that it has received it. The receiver does this by sending an `ACK` segment, containing the sequence number of the last segment that it successfully received. If the sender sends a packet but does not receive an `ACK` for it within a certain time window, the sender simply resends it. The re-sent segment has the same sequence number as the initial segment, so if the original packet arrives late, or if it already arrived but the receiver's `ACK` for it got lost, the receiver will can trivially de-duplicate them without corrupting the stream. Unnecessarily re-sent segments are a definite hardware and network overhead, but as long as they are relatively infrequent they are not a problem. As long as a segment eventually reaches the receiver and the corresponding `ACK` eventually reaches the sender, the connection will work.

In a perfect, reliable, consistent network, receivers would receive segments in the same order that they were sent. Since networks are none of those things, segments are typically received all jumbled up, but receivers can use sequence numbers to stich them back together in the correct order. However, if a receiver receives a segment with a sequence number that is "too" out of order (more on how exactly this is determined shortly) then it discards it. This demonstrates the first challenge that makes TCP reset attacks difficult. Segment sequence numbers are determined by adding on to an initial sequence number. Each machine in a TCP connection randomly chooses an initial sequence number when the connection is being created, and sends it to the other party. So long as these initial sequence numbers are truly generated randomly, attackers don't know what sequence number to give their `RST` segments so that they don't appear to be "too" out of order.

This is not a problem for an attacker who can monitor the traffic being exchanged between two victims. Sequence numbers (like all TCP/IP headers) are not encrypted, and can be read by anyone with access to the traffic. Such an attacker can read sequence numbers, read which segments have been acknowledged, and attempt to use this information to craft a `RST` segment with a sequence number that will be accepted by its target. Attackers without visibility into the traffic (for example, if I decided to try to disrupt your connection with Facebook without any visibility into your network) have no idea what sequence number to use. They can still attempt a *blind TCP reset attack* by using entirely random sequence numbers, and in fact such an attack would have worked quite well until a mitigation was put into place in 20XX-TODO as part of RFC123-TODO.

### What sequence numbers are acceptable for a `RST` segment?

A few paragraphs ago we said that TCP segments will only be accepted if they have a sequence number that is not "too" out-of-order. What counts as "too" out-of-order is determined by a party's *TCP window size*.

When data is sent on a TCP connection, it must be successfully received and processed at the other end. There's no use a sender firing out segment after segment if they arrive at the other end faster than the receiver can process them. Imagine that your over-zealous friend is mailing you a torrent of letters, and they are arriving in your mailbox faster that you can retrieve and read them. Your mailbox fills up, the overflow letters spill out onto the floor, where they are eaten by foxes or whatever critters live in your area. Your friend will have to re-send those letters once you've had time to catch up with their earlier missives. Sending too many letters or too much data when the recipient is unable to process them is a pure waste of energy and bandwidth.

This is where the TCP window size comes in. A party's window size is a number that represents the maximum number of unacknowledged bytes that a sender may send it at any one time. Recall that every TCP segment must be explicitly acknowledged by its recipient in order for its sender to consider it to have arrived safely.

Suppose that a receiver advertises a window size of 100,000. The sender fires off 100,000 bytes. By the time it has sent the 100,000th byte, the receiver has sent it `ACK`s for 10,000 of those bytes. This means that there are 90,000 bytes still un-acked. Since the window size is 100,000, this leaves 10,000 bytes that the sender can send before it has to stop. After sending those 10,000 bytes the sender will have hit the limit of 100,000 un-acknowledged bytes. The sender will therefore have to wait and not send any more data (apart from re-sending data that it believe may be lost) until it receives an `ACK` for some of it.

Because of this hard limit on the amount of data that a sender may send at any one time, a receiver knows the exact range of sequence numbers that it should be able to receive. The maximum sequence number of a segment that the sender should send is:

```
max_seq_no = max_acked_seq_no + window_size
```

`max_acked_seq_no` is the maximum sequence number that the receiver has sent an `ACK` for. From the sender's point of view, this is the maximum sequence number that it knows that the receiver has received successfully. In order to abide by the rule that it should not send more than `window_size` unacknowledged bytes at any one time, it should not send a segment with a sequence number greater CONTINUE








This is a problem for a common-or-garden attacker, but not for a government with complete visibility into internet traffic. 










This means that receivers can receive segments in the wrong order and then use their sequence number to stitch them back together correctly. 

If a segment arrives with a sequence number far 





When two machines open a TCP connection with each other, they perform a *handshake*. This is a ritual of negotiating the details of the connection. One of these details is 





The internet is often described as running on "TCP over IP". 









Using a standard networking protocol called *Border Gateway Protocol* (BGP), the government instructs Chinese internet service providers (ISPs) to block (or *null route*) all traffic to these IP addresses.

In DNS pollution, the government once again manipulates internet standards. The internet doesn't understand domains like `robertheaton.com`; instead, it only understands IP addresses like `104.18.32.191`. When a computer wants to communicate with a domain it has to first translate the domain to an IP address. It does so using the Domain Name System, or DNS. It sends a *DNS request* to a *DNS server* asking "what is the IP address for `robertheaton.com`


In this series of blog posts, we will learn about the core purpose and mechanics of TCP. Armed with this knowledge we will analyze, in detail, how a TCP reset attack works. We will perform one on ourselves.


A "TCP connection" doesn't mean that there's a set of switches kept open for you. Just means that sequence numbers are being kept track of
