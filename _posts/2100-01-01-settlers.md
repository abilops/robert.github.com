During covid lockdown my family and I have been staying happy and alert by playing a game of Catan every evening. I come from a line of solid, competent Catan players, so in an effort to increase my win-rate I've been searching for articles about advanced settling strategy. I haven't found many that offer the level of nuance I need to destroy my household, so I've decided to write my own. I believe that this guide will give you a noticable edge in any kitchen table game. If you think I've missed anything or got something wrong, please do [let me know][about]!

## Initial settlement placement

### Wheat and ore are important

I think that the two most important resources are wheat and ore. Wheat is the most important because it's needed for building anything other than a road. Ore is the second most important because there are only 3 tiles of it, and without it you can't get more than 7 points (5 settlements plus longest road). The combination of wheat and ore is particularly potent because it allows you to build cities, which - as we'll discuss later - are generally more powerful than settlements.

Because of this, when placing my first settlement I start by looking for spots with good numbers on both wheat and ore. If such spots exist, I'll probably take one of them. If they don't, I'll try to get a spot with a good number on one of these resources, and check to see whether I am likely to be able to get a good number on the other resource with my second settlement. I usually expect wheat to be easier to come by than ore because there are 4 wheat hexes and only 3 ores, but if it's only possible to get one of these resources then wheat takes priority.

### Other strategies are good too

If I can't get good ore numbers then I don't immediately start sulking. A strategy focussed on settlements, longest road, and a smattering of ore is also viable. The longest road is critical for this strategy, so it's important to have better wood and brick production than your opponents.

### A resources value depends on which other resources are available

Every resource requires other resources in order to be useful. This means that the value of a resource depends on which other resources you have. For example, wood and brick are both only used to build roads and settlements, and can each only be used when combined with the other. Ignoring trading with other players and the bank, every wood card you pick up is useless without a corresponding brick.

This means that you want to produce roughly the same amount of wood and brick. There's no point having 10 pips on wood, but only 4 on brick. You're going to end up trading most of those excess woods 4-to-1 with the bank. A practical example - suppose you are choosing where to place your first settlement. There are a 2, 4, and 11 on brick, and a 3, 3, 8, and 12 on wood.

Even though the 8-wood is the only decent wood number, you should not prioritize it too highly. This is because it's unlikely that you'll be able to get much brick to go with your wood. If you can pick up the 8-wood without giving up much then you should still take it, but you shouldn't expect to be able to build a sprawling road and settlement empire. You might be best off seeing if an ore/wheat strategy is possible instead.

### How bad is it to double-up your numbers?

If your first settlement is on a 4, 6, and 10, then you ideally don't want to place your second settlement on another 4, 6, and 10. This doubling-up of your numbers means that you'll get resources in feasts and famines, making trading more difficult and making you more likely to have to throw away cards when a 7 is rolled. However, my intuition is that doubling-up numbers is not too harmful, and that you should not adjust your choices much to account for it. It's arguably even desirable to double-up symbiotic resources on the same numbers, for example getting wood and brick on the same roll. I'm still not sure if it's better to have a 5-wood and a 5-brick, or a 5-wood and a 9-brick.

### Ports

I don't recommend all-in port strategies because they are expensive to use. Even though you're getting a better-than-normal rate, trading resources at a rate of 2- or 3-for-1 still leaves you down net cards. Instead of having 12 pips on sheep plus the sheep port, you would usually be better off simply having a balanced portfolio of the full spectrum of resources. However, ports can be a useful garnish on top of a diverse industrial empire. Whilst it is better to simply pick up an ore than to have to trade 2 or 3 sheep for one, in a pinch the flexibility to smelt sheep can be invaluable.

In addition, the more skewed the number-resource distribution, the more highly I value ports. If all the good numbers are on wood and sheep, but wheat only has a 2, 3, 4 and 12, you might be well-advised to place one of your starting settlements on or next to a useful port in order to produce your wheat via the backdoor.

### Predict where your opponents will place their starting settlements

Predicting where your opponents will place their own starting settlements is important for two reasons. When placing your first settlements it helps you guess which spots will still be available when you come to place your second settlement. This can help you decide which resources are important to snap up as soon as possible, and which risks are safe to take. Then when placing your second settlement, predicting your opponents' choices can help you guess which spots will be available for your first expansion settlement, allowing you to point your road in the best direction.

If you regularly play with the same people, try to learn their preferences and play styles. Some people place a high premium on having at least one hex on every resource type. Some people love building roads. Some love ports; others hate them. Your guesses won't always be right, but you can usually gain something from this exercise.

### Predict how you will win

When placing your starting settlements, have a plan in mind for how you will reach 10 points. For an ore/wheat/sheep heavy strategy this might be "3 cities, largest army, 2 victory point (VP) cards." For a wood/brick strategy it might be "5 settlements, longest road, expand to some mediocre ore hexes and eke out 2 cities and a VP card". This will help you understand what your focus should be during the game, and check that your starting settlements do give you a plausible path to victory.

## Building roads

### Jostling for position

You will often be directly competing with your opponents to build roads and settlements in premium expansion spots. Your primary goal should be to win these races; your secondary goal should be to avoid investing too many resources into races that you lose. Building one, two, or more roads that turn out to be useless can be very costly.

Sometimes your road will butt up directly against your opponent's road.

This situation is a pure race. There are no subtelties - just do whatever it takes to build a road in position X before they do. I find that these confrontations are relatively rare because they require one player to build an aggressive road without immediately following it up with another road that blocks the other player off entirely. When considering placing a starting settlement and road in a race position, make sure your opponent can't place their second settlement on a wood and a brick to get an instant road.

More common is a position like the following:

<img src="/images/settlers-road-offset.png" />

As the red player, consider building the road at position X so as to completely lock the blue player out of building a settlement at position S. As the blue player, consider saving up for 2 roads to zoom past red and snap-block them.

This final scenario is in many ways the most complex and delicate:

<img src="/images/settlers-road-standoff.png" />

Neither player has an advantage, and it will be several roads or settlements before the tension of who gets to build at position S is resolved. You must use your judgement. As either player, consider building a road towards the contested spot as soon as you can so as to dissuade your opponent from competing for it. If you do so, make sure they aren't in a position to quickly build a road and a settlement. Pay attention to your opponent's other options. Are they fighting for any other spaces that are better than this one? Have they gone so far as to build a road towards this other spot? If yes then you will be more likely to be able to claim this spot unchallenged. On the other hand, if your opponent is being suspiciously inactive then they may be saving up for a quick road-settlement combo.

If you can't quite build a settlement but are concerned that your opponent is about to steal the spot from you, consider blocking off their road if you can. This road is likely to be purely prophylactic and otherwise pointless, so don't build it unless you have to.

In all these scenarios, be more cautious about building roads if you are playing an ore/wheat/sheep-heavy strategy and have relatively little wood and brick. You need to make sure that the woods and bricks you do have are spent productively. By constrast, if you are flush with road-building materials and are going to be fighting for the longest road, build roads more freely.

## Development cards

### Don't buy cards just because you can

Look for reasons not to buy cards. "I have an ore, a wheat, and a sheep" is not a good reason to buy a card. Are you really at risk of having to discard to a 7? Would a knight really help you? (see below) Often, saving your resources to build a settlement or a city is the correct play.

### Buy cards if you have juicy robber targets

Half of the cards in the development card deck are knights. In a vacuum, knights are not worth the resources you pay for them. However, several circumstances can increase their value, such as when you have juicy robber targets like a city and a settlement on a 6-ore. The robber will frequently end up on your valuable hex, so having an army of knights to chase it away is useful, and particularly important if you are the only person who has built on the hex. When you are the only player on a hex more other players will have an incentive to put the robber on it, and no one else will chase the robber away for you. In some games it can feel like you're getting unlucky or unfairly victimized by the robber; the correct response is to buy more development cards.

### Buy cards if you will be able to buy more cards in the future

Another way in which knights can become more valuable is if you will be competing for the largest army bonus. You should be more likely to buy a card now if you have lots of ore and will be able to buy more cards and amass more knights in the future.

### Buy a card if your group avoids putting the robber on people with cards

Fearing retribution, many people avoid putting the robber on a player with a face-down card. I don't know if this is a good strategy or not (at the very least it seems like a reasonable tie-breaker), but if your group plays like this then a single card can be a good investment to scare potential aggressors away.

### Use your cards early so that the benefit of them compounds for longer

Building a city on turn 5 is much more valuable than building one on turn 25 because you benefit from its production for 20 extra turns. Tend to use your cards early so that you start benefiting from their effects sooner.

### Use your cards late to confuse your opponents

People are bad at playing around hidden information. You know what your card is and so can play optimally. So long as your card remains face down your opponents don't know what it is and so will play sub-optimally. I'm not sure how to trade off this effect with the previous one.

### Buy your development cards first and one at a time

When you build a road, settlement, or city, you know exactly what the outcome will be. You will place a piece on the board, and someone will grumble about how you are winning and everyone should gang up on you. However, when you buy a development card, you don't know which card you will get. The outcome may influence the rest of your turn. If you are going to build multiple items in a single turn, buy your cards first in case they change your other decisions. For the same reason, don't buy 3 cards at once. Instead, buy a card, look at it, consider the situation, then buy the next card and repeat.

## The robber

### Shared hexes are safer

As discussed above, hexes that are shared with one or more other players are relatively safe from the robber. This is a good reason to place your starting settlements on or expand to shared hexes.

### The robber is an emotional thing

I don't claim to be a master of manipulation and table talk, but be aware that where your opponents place the robber is an emotional decision that you may be able to influence. Some people will be scared off if you swear that you will lash back at them if they rob you; others will be antagonized. Some will respond well to you explaining why other players are winning and need to be brought down a peg; others will steal your stuff to make you shut up.

### Don't steal from someone with 8 cards

If an opponent has 8 cards, tend not to steal from them and bring them within the 7 card threshold. Similarly, if you have 7 cards then you should probably wait until you've rolled the dice before using your soldier, even if the robber is on one of your important hexes.

### Stategically arrange your cards when getting stolen from

I'm not sure about the ethics of this tip. I think it's probably perfectly legal, but should probably be house-ruled away.

I've noticed that when stealing a random card from your hand, most people never choose the card at the front or back. This means that if you keep your most important 2 cards at the front and back of your hand, you will never lose them.

The Catan rules don't make it clear whether it is the defending player's responsibility to help make the stolen card random. The argument for this being a kosher tactic is that it's difficult to ensure that people aren't doing it (unless you require the defending player to randomize their hand before being stolen from), so it should be permitted and the onus should be on the stealing player to respond to it. The argument against the tactic is that the stealing player's cast-iron defence against it is to use a random number generator to select their card, which is a tedious hassle. For the good of the game, perhaps everyone should just agree to not stack their hands, to not slow down the game with random number generators, and to remember that we're all just having fun around our kitchen tables.

## Trading

### Make any trade that increases your expected win percentage

It is sometimes said that you should only do a trade if it is better for you than it is for your opponent. This is not the right way to think about a multiplayer game. It is possible for a trade to be good for you, even better for your opponent, and still the right thing for you to do. Suppose you are playing a 4-player game, and right now everyone has a 25% chance of winning. Your opponent offers a trade that leaves them with a 30% chance of winning, you a 28% chance, and the other 2 players a 21% chance. Even though this trade is better for your opponent than you, you should still take it because it increases your win chances too, which is the only statistic that matters.

In practice I suspect that this point is so fine as to be irrelevant, but it's still interesting to consider.

### Accept a trade that is neutral for you if someone else would have accepted it

If a trade is neutral for you then you generally don't want to make it. Presumably it is good for your counterparty, otherwise they wouldn't have offered it, so you are helping them gain something without getting anything in return. However, when two other people trade with each other it is good for *both* of them. You therefore want to be able to break up trades that don't involve you by jumping in and accepting them yourself, even if the outcome for you remains neutral. One of the traders still gets the resources they wanted, but you at least manage to frustrate the other failed trader.

### Think about what your opponent is going to do with the cards you give them

If an opponent is trying to amass the resources to make an important build, you should either refuse to trade with them or drive a hard bargain. The most profitable situation to do this is if they are competing with another player to be the first to build a road. Any gains they make come almost entirely at the expense of their combatant, meaning that you can charge a high price and don't even lose out when they build.

## Misc

### Cities are generally better than settlements

Cities are generally better than settlements. This is because you will usually be building your expansion settlements on the arid leftover spots that weren't taken during the setup phase. By contrast, your cities will be doubling up your best spots and producing substantially more than a sterile settlement. Plus, when you factor in the cost of roads, settlements usually work out to be more expensive than cities. This said, cities are tempting robber targets, and building settlements at the start of the game means that you stake out land that you can upgrade into cities later in the game. Nonetheless, overall I think you should prefer cities.
