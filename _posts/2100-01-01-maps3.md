Group data together

Separate piles of data, have to sift through it all when you want to do something
Not a problem for performance (yet)

But we can almost view each category as an entirely separate thing
They just happen to sit in the same browser window
One possible way of structuring the application is to group each category's info together
Make it easier to say "hide all this category's places" or "what are this category's places?"

Could go further and wrap this logic up inside methods on a class
Won't go that far in this piece, but this would make for pleasant-to-read code
Category knows how to handle its own business, the main part of the code just tells it what it needs to do
This model could start to break down if we got more cross-dependencies, but we'll see
Try not to encode too many hard assumptions
