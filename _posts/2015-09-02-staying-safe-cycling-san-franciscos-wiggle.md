In the past year, untold numbers of cyclists have tragically [lost $198 at the hands of the SFPD](http://sf.streetsblog.org/2015/08/05/sfpd-park-station-begins-pointless-harassment-of-bike-commuters) whilst rolling over stop signs along [the Wiggle](https://localwiki.org/sf/The_Wiggle), a popoular San Francisco bike route .

The SFPD is right - bikes and cars [should be treated identically at stop signs](http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2015/07/30/wiggle-stop-in-cyclists-bring-san-francisco-traffic-to-a-standstill-wednesday/). Cars weigh several tonnes, can travel arbitrarily fast as far as your skull is concerned and require a complex series of mirrors and blind spots to see their surroundings; exactly like bikes are also none of these things.

So please, educate yourselves and your loved ones with these 3 ways to stay safe:

1. Always be vigilant - patrol cars can come from any direction, no matter how hard you think you have checked. When going over a junction, devote a minimum of 50% of your attention to looking out for police vehicles, especially those behind you or several blocks away.

2. Check your visibility - wear dark clothing to make it harder for officers to see you.

3. Take safe routes - avoid quiet roads with clearly marked bike paths, like The Wiggle, since these are where the crackdowns happen. Prefer congested, car-heavy streets with no room for cyclists.

Together we can raise a new generation of cyclists, where no one has to know what it's like to lose $198.
