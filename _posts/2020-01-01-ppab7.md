We'll talk about validating and pre-processing input, and about what to do when you need your function to return more than one value

Small touches that make a big difference, especially when multiplied many times in every single project
Also get you thinking about how your code feels to use and read******

## Validating and pre-processing input

We talk a lot about *interfaces* in PFAB. Your functions say "you give me X, I'll do Y, and give you back Z." However, sometimes users of your code will give the wrong type of input. Maybe they give you a string when you need an integer (not a problem in *statically typed* languages), or maybe they give you a list containing 2 elements when you need a list containing 3.

Invalid input can cause strange and unexpected things to happen, so it's generally good practice to validate the inputs that programmers using your library pass into it.

Sometimes input is technically invalid, but only because it's in an abbreviated form. For example, suppose you have a function that takes in a dictionary of test scores:

```
{
    'rob': {
        'algebra': 10,
        'history': 8
    },
    'sally': {
        'algebra': 12,
        'geography': 7
    },
    # etc...
}
```

Your function's internal logic requires that every person have a score set for every test, and have `None` if they didn't take the test:

```
{
    'rob': {
        'algebra': 10,
        'geography': None,
        'history': 8
    },
    'sally': {
        'algebra': 12,
        'geography': 7
        'history': None,
    },
    # etc...
}
```

We could have our function validate that every person has a score set for every test, and raise an exception if they don't.

```python
def calculate_averages(test_scores):
    if not all_tests_have_scores(test_scores):
        raise Exception("Some tests are missing scores!")
    # If all tests have scores, perform calculations
```

However, suppose that there are lots of students, and lots of different tests they could have taken. Filling in the blanks might be an annoying chore for our user.

Instead, it would be a reasonable design decision to adjust the function's interface to require a dictionary of test scores, and if a person is missing a score for a test, assume that they haven't taken the test and programmatically fill it in with `None`. Then pass this *pre-processed* dictionary into the main logic of the function.

```python
def calculate_averages(test_scores):
    processed_scores = fill_in_missing_nones(test_scores)
    # Now perform calculation using `processed_scores`
```

Notice that I say that doing this would be 


Sometimes invalid input won't cause a program to break, but it will cause it to behave strangely. For example, what should happen if I try to use my online banking app to transfer you `-$100`? What could happen if the code doesn't have enough input validation?








Validation may prevent 

This may cause strange and unexpected things to happen.






Your functions and components have *interfaces*
