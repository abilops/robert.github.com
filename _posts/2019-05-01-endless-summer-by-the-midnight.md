[Endless Summer by The Midnight](https://themidnight.bandcamp.com/album/endless-summer) is one of the best, purest, smoothest synthwave albums ever. Here are a few notes about its chords and production.

## General notes

* Almost every single chord is inside the root key of the song
* About half the loops don't start with their root chord. Some never play the root chord at all
* I didn't bother trying to figure out the exact augmentations of each chord. Most are probably enriched with 2nds, 4ths, 6ths, and 7ths in some combination according to taste. A few chords have clear, audible augmentations; in particular, some include prominent 7ths, and some only work as sus4s
* About half the songs are the exact same 4 bar loop throughout the entire song. Variation and interest comes entirely from the arrangement. The most common automation technique is opening and closing a low-pass filter.
* Many of the songs that aren't the same loop all the way through still simply rearrange and reorder 3 or 4 core chords

## 1. Endless Summer

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xF656KUqeEo) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-endless-summer-official-audio-the-midnight)

```
Entire song:
Abmaj7 / Cm7 / Fm
IV / VIm / IV / IIm
```

* The song sometimes uses `Bb` to get from `Ab` to `Cm7`
* The song is in the key of `Eb`, but the chord `Eb` is never played
* You can most clearly hear the 7s in the `Abmaj7` and `Cm7` in the pad chords that play around 3:35
* There's fairly heavy sidechain compression on the bass that I think would sound out of place in most other, less "artificial" sounding songs by the Midnight

## 2. Sunset

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2D4iCzRW7E) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-sunset-newretrowave)

```
Entire song:
Bb / C / Dm / F
Bb / C / Dm / C

IV / V / VIm / I
IV / V / VIm / V
```

* I like the heavily low-passed drums at 2:30, you can just make out the distinction between the kick and the snare
* When the bass moves from `C` to `Dm` it dips down to `A` for one note. This is a tiny but neat variation on the standard thumping root note synthwave bass.

## 3. Daytona
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=180&v=9RXoqMus5ZU) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-daytona-official-audio-the-midnight)

```
Main:
C / D / Em / Bm
VI / VII / Im / Vm

Solo:
D / C / Eb / F
```

* This is one of two songs on the album that include a chord outside of the root key (the `Eb` in the solo)
* The hits in the transitions between chords in the solo are something like:
  * `D` => `C` goes via `Am` => `G/B`
  * `C` => `Eb` goes via `Bb/D` (not certain about this one)
  * `Eb` => `F` goes via `Gm`

## 4. Jason

```
Intro:
Dm / C

Verse:
Dm / C / Bb

Chorus:
Bb / C / Dm

Turnaround at end of solo:
Dm / C / Gm / Am / Bb / C / Bm
```

* The `Bm` at the end of the solo is the only chromatic chord in the album. It helps get from the key of `Dm` to the relative major key of `Bb`. It sounds great.

## 5. Synthetic

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apFW_End3oM) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-synthetic-lyrics-marco)

```
Verse:
Ab / Cm / Bb
I / IIIm / II

Chorus:
Ab / Bb / Cm / Eb
Ab / Bb / Cm
I / II / IIIm / V
I / II / IIIm
```

* The chorus only uses `Eb` to get from `Cm` back to `Ab` on every other loop. This adds variation and avoids overusing the pleasant but prominent transition.

## 6. The Equaliser (Not Alone)

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YP5oIrV0ONk) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-the-equaliser-not-alone-upliftingnova)

```
Whole song:
Dm / C / Bb in various combinations

Guitar solo:
Throws in two rounds of Bb / C / Dm / Gsus4 towards the end
```

* The guitar solo has [a lick](https://youtu.be/YP5oIrV0ONk?t=141) that’s very similar to the chorus of ["Shadows"](https://youtu.be/sGwtkJaQ9n0?t=164)
* The `Gsus4` in the guitar solo has to be a `sus4`, it makes no sense with either a major or a minor third

## 7. The Comeback Kid

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVoVA6itDmI) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-the-comeback-kid-lyric-video-floydian-dip)

```
Entire song:
C / G / F
C / G / F
Am / Em / F
Am / G / F
```

* The second half of the sequence (the `Am/Em/F` and `Am/G/F` lines) is a nice, subtle variation on the first half. Since `Am` and `Em` are the relative minors of `C` and `G` the two halves are close to harmonically identical. This means that the same loops can be played over the top with very little risk of dissonance.

## 8. Vampires

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBs-lPvk3Zk) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-vampires-newretrowave)

````
Most of the song:
Bbm / Db / Ab / Gb
Im / III / VII / VI

Chorus:
Bbm / Db / Ab / Gb
Bbm / Db / Ab / Gb
Ebm / Fm / Gb
Bbm / Db / Ab / Gb

End of solo:
Ab / Fm / Gb
Bbm / Db / Ab / Gb
```

## 9. Crockett's Revenge

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNXYc-JThH8) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-crockett-s-revenge-neonaether)

```
Am / G / F / G
Am / G / F / Em
```

* The pattern that the bell that comes in at the start plays feels quite trancey. Reminds me of [Offshore by Chicane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhXT15esYv8)

## 10. Nighthawks

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI-oguRJFb8) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-nighthawks-yakyle-new-retro-wave)

```
Whole song:
C#m / E / Amaj7
```

* The major 7 in the `Amaj7` is very audible

## 11. Lonely City

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AbIiBluyWA) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-lonely-city-upliftingnova)

```
Most of the song:
A / C#m / B in various combinations

Towards the end:
Amaj7 / C#m / B
Amaj7 / B / F#sus4
```

* The major 7 in the `Amaj7` is again audible and important

## 12. Memories

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQqFeCCuwW0) / [Chordify](https://chordify.net/chords/the-midnight-memories-music-video-some-kind-of-classic)

```
Entire song:
D / Bm / G / A / Bm
```

* The doubling on the vocals in the verse is great (eg. [at 2:43](https://youtu.be/JQqFeCCuwW0?t=163)). There’s a lot of separation between the main line and the harmony. I think there might be stereo widening on the main line and narrowing on the harmony.
