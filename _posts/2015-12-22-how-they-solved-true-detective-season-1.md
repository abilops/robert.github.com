This is how Detectives Rusty Coehl and Marty Hart solved the murder of Dora Lange in [True Detective Season 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective_(season_1)). I have focussed on events that contributed directly to the chain of clues and suggestions that led to the solution, leaving out those that focus purely on characters.
