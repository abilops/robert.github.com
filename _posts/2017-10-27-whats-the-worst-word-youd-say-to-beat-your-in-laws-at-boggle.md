What's the worst word you'd say to beat your in-laws at Boggle?
<br/>
I know exactly what mine is.
<br/>

It's one of those words that not everyone knows
<br/>
And those that do think you're disgusting.
<br/>
You and I aren’t that close so I’ll call this word “fleem”.
<br/>

Playing Boggle with my in-laws, I spot the word "fleem"
<br/>
I write it down and hope I won't need it.
<br/>
The timer goes off
<br/>
Our words are read out
<br/>
And the scores are tied, eighteen apiece.
<br/>

My heart sinks.
<br/>

I shout out "I've got fleem!"
<br/>
An argument erupts
<br/>
"That's not a real word. And also, you're disgusting."
<br/>
A dictionary comes out
<br/>
And it's not a real word.
<br/>
Fuck.
<br/>

I speak to my parents next day on the phone.
<br/>
They're grown-ups so I tell them the story.
<br/>
"What does fleem mean?" - my dad.
<br/>
I hang up.
<br/>

Dad calls his mum, my grandma, to say hi
<br/>
No answer, it goes straight to voicemail
<br/>
He puts down the phone.
<br/>

He looks up what "fleem" means, he wrinkles his nose.
<br/>
He shouts it out loud to my mum.
<br/>
"That's nice dear" she says. "And also, you're disgusting."
<br/>

The next thing that mum hears is dad crying out
<br/>
She rushes in, he's collapsed on the floor.
<br/>
And all that she sees, in his puce pallid hands
<br/>
Is the phone
<br/>
Still connected to his mum, my grandma, my eighty-eight year old grandma
<br/>
Who will soon know what fleem means when she next checks her voicemail.
<br/>

My dad's mum, my grandma, died a few months ago
<br/>
She was a wonderful and beautiful and knowledgable person.
<br/>
They never spoke about what happened
<br/>
We all think that was for the best.
